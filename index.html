            Hello! I'm Danish Ghumman, a dedicated and dynamic Computer Science
            major from the University of Pittsburgh, driven by a passion for
            problem-solving and a steadfast commitment to continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of technology began in an unexpected way.
            Originally on a path toward physical therapy, I made the bold
            decision to switch to computer science, despite my initial lack of
            knowledge in the field. This leap into the unknown was not just a
            change of major—it was the start of a new chapter in my life that
            ignited a fervent curiosity and a tenacious resolve to delve deeper
            into the complexities of computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the beginning, I faced numerous challenges, from grasping
            fundamental concepts to applying them in practical, team-based
            projects. However, these hurdles did not deter me; they fueled my
            ambition and taught me the importance of adaptability and
            perseverance. These qualities have become the cornerstones of my
            approach to both personal and professional challenges, allowing me
            to thrive in a field that is perpetually evolving.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continue to advance in my career, I am eager to take on new
            challenges, contribute to groundbreaking projects, and further my
            education. With a strong foundation in both the theoretical and
            practical aspects of computer science, combined with my adaptability
            and perseverance, I am ready to make a significant impact in the
            tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I am excited to explore
            opportunities to collaborate and innovate together.
          </p>

          <h2 class="major">Personal Philosophy Statement</h2>

          <p>
            I remember my sophomore year being quite the struggle as I made a
            drastic change in my academic career, switching majors. I decided to
            leave physical therapy to pursue a computer science degree. This
            change had come due to many factors but one thing was for sure, I
            did not know anything about computers. And there I was, thrown into
            my first group project unsure of what to do and given three weeks to
            figure it out. However, with the confusion and uncertainty, a hunger
            for knowledge blossomed and a passion for problem-solving that I
            hadn't realized I possessed. This experience taught me the value of
            adaptability and perseverance, traits that have since defined my
            approach to both work and learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adaptability has become my cornerstone, allowing me to navigate the
            constantly evolving field of computer science with an open mind and
            a readiness to learn. In a domain where technologies and programming
            languages are perpetually everchanging, my ability to adapt quickly
            has been invaluable. Transitioning from theoretical coursework to
            practical, hands-on development required not only technical skill
            but also the ability to adapt to new tools and methodologies. My
            success in the previous experiences I’ve had was not just in the
            completion of the task but in the journey of learning and adaptation
            that accompanied it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perseverance, on the other hand, has empowered me to tackle
            challenges with determination and resilience. The journey from
            knowing nothing about computers to becoming proficient in languages
            like Java and Python was full of obstacles. Yet, it was my
            unwavering commitment to my goals that saw me through. My project on
            developing a Crossword Solver in Java is a testament to this
            perseverance. The project demanded not only a deep understanding of
            the language but also the creativity to devise a recursive
            backtracking algorithm—a challenge that I met with relentless effort
            and dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I look forward to embarking on new challenges, whether it be
            pursuing a challenging role in the tech industry, contributing to
            innovative projects, or furthering my education, I am confident that
            my adaptability and perseverance will be my greatest assets. These
            qualities have prepared me to tackle the unknown, to learn and grow
            from every experience, and to contribute meaningfully to my future
            endeavors and to the success of the organizations I will be a part
            of. My journey from a struggling sophomore to a proficient computer
            scientist is a testament to the transformative power of adaptability
            and perseverance, and it is these qualities that I bring to every
            project, team, and challenge I encounter.
          </p>

		  <h2 class="major">Diversity Statement</h2>
		  <p>
			As a first-generation college student from a Pakistani background, I embrace the rich tapestry of cultures, perspectives, and experiences that have shaped who I am today. My journey into the field of computer science at the University of Pittsburgh has not only been an academic pursuit but also a personal mission to bridge cultural gaps and foster an environment of inclusion and respect.
			<p>Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have witnessed the transformative power of diversity in driving innovation and solving complex problems. My commitment to diversity is reflected in my collaborative projects and leadership roles, where I have consistently advocated for equity and embraced the unique contributions of each team member.</p>
			I believe that an inclusive community is the cornerstone of effective problem-solving and creativity in technology. As such, I am dedicated to supporting and promoting diversity initiatives within the tech industry. I strive to create spaces that are welcoming to all, particularly those from underrepresented groups, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to contribute their voice and talents to our collective endeavors.
			By integrating my cultural heritage and the values I hold dear, I aim to inspire future generations of technologists to approach their work with an open heart and a global perspective. I am committed to continuing this journey, learning from others, and contributing to a more inclusive and diverse field.

			<h3> Junior Salesforce Administrator</h3>
			<img src="images/salesforce.jpg" alt="salesforce" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
  
			<p>
				My role involved utilizing SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) extensively to effectively manage and eliminate duplicate records in our database, 
				significantly enhancing both data accuracy and integrity. 
				This crucial task involved crafting precise queries to identify overlaps and redundancies, allowing for meticulous data cleanup and maintenance. 
				Additionally, I implemented robust agile development methodologies within Salesforce, focusing on tiered user authentication mechanisms in test environments. This approach not only bolstered data security but also ensured finely tuned access control, preventing unauthorized data access and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. 
				These improvements were pivotal in streamlining data management processes and enhancing overall system security within the organization.

			<h3> AI/Machine Learning Intern </h3>
			<img src="images/ai.jpg" alt="ai" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
  
			<p> 
				During my internship at the University of Pittsburgh, I aided in the development of an innovative AI model using Python. This model is designed to accurately discern voice gender and age, facilitating real-time interactive feedback between parents and children, 
				which can be particularly beneficial in educational and developmental applications. In addition to this, I significantly enhanced our audio analysis capabilities by developing a sophisticated algorithm utilizing both PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
				This algorithm optimizes the voice data labeling process, streamlining the analysis of audio segments and improving the efficiency and accuracy of our data processing workflows.
